**About transaction fees**

Please note that small transaction fees will be required when performing migration. If you do not have USTC, you can get USTC from [here](https://support.c2x.world) where we are giving away USTC for free as a support measure. Please note that in order to receive the support, you must have more than 1 C2X and less than 0.2 USTC in your C2X Station.
Please read the following article (https://link.medium.com/CEYbVj3C7sb) for more information about the USTC fee support.
