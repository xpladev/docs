`xplad` is the command-line interface and node daemon that connects to XPLA Chain and enables you to interact with the XPLA Chain. XPLA Chain core is the official Golang reference implementation of the XPLA Chain node software.

This guide is for developers who want to install `xplad` and interact with XPLA Chain core without running a full node. If you want to run a full node or join a network, visit [Run a Full Node]({{< ref "run-a-full-node" >}}).
