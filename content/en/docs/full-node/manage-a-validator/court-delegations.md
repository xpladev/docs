Consider the following options to help improve your visibility and make yourself known to potential delegators.

## Set-up a Website

Set up a website so that your delegators can find you. It is recommended that you make a custom section for XPLA Chain delegators that instructs them how to delegate XPLA tokens.

## Announce Yourself on Discord

Join the [XPLA Chain Validators Discord](https://discord.gg/vUBcwm3r6t) channel, and introduce yourself.

## Put a Thumbnail on XPLA Vault

Create a [Keybase Account](https://keybase.io/) follow the Keybase instructions to set up a PGP key, and upload a profile picture.
For best continuity use the same GitHub account to verify your Keybase.

Now link your Keybase profile to your validator. Open your validator terminal and execute this command:

```bash
xplad tx staking edit-validator \
    --identity="keybase identity"
```
