Running a full XPLA Chain node is a resource-intensive process that requires a persistent server. If you want to use XPLA Chain without downloading the entire blockchain, use [XPLA web vault](https://vault.xpla.io/).

If you are a developer and want to install `xplad`, visit [xplad install guide]({{< ref "install-xplad" >}}).
