## Migration Procedure

{{< alert context="warning" >}}
**Important**

You must first agree to the following disclaimer by checking the box and clicking “Agree” before you proceed with the migration. Please keep in mind that in no event XPLA is liable for any loss that occurred during the migration process, so it is very important that you follow all of the given instructions to safely complete the migration procedure. Please refer to the whitepaper for detailed tokenomics behind XPLA chain.

The following screen will appear after agreeing to the disclaimer and connecting your C2X Station. Check If the shown address under “Terra Classic” is correct, and please copy and paste your XPLA Vault or C2X Station’s address under “XPLA”.

Click “Next” once checking both blanks are filled with correct addresses to proceed to the next step.

Here, you can pick the type of migration you wish to undertake. If you wish to migrate everything at once, please click “Migrate All”. Or, if you wish to take some time and only migrate some at a time, please click “Migrate by your choice”.

In “Migrate All”, you can view all of the CTX you currently hold in your C2X Station. You can migrate all of your CTX to XPLA chain at once by clicking “Migrate”.

On the other hand, if you wish to migrate some of your assets first, click "Migrate by your choice" and the following screen with tick boxes will appear to the left of all of the assets you own in your C2X Station. Here, you can manually pick which assets and how many of them to migrate over to the XPLA chain.
If you change your mind and wish to migrate everything at once, you can also do it here by clicking the button "Max".

**Note**

You can only migrate CTX for now, you will be able to migrate other tokens and assets from games after each of them has migrated to XPLA chain.

After deciding on which tokens and how many of them to migrate, click "Next" to review and double check before executing the migration.

Please migrate all your assets in your C2X Station to XPLA chain when you can because it can become quite troublesome to enjoy everything what XPLA has to offer without appropriate tokens. We're only getting started so stay tuned as we revolutionize the gaming space.
