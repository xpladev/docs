   **Protect your mnemonic keys**

   Anyone with your mnemonic phrase can access your money, and there is no recourse for someone stealing your mnemonic phrase. To protect your mnemonic phrase, consider the following tips:
   - Never save or store your mnemonic phrase as a digital file on any device.
   - Always write down your mnemonic phrase with a pen and paper.
   - Store the paper with your mnemonic phrase on it somewhere safe.
   - Never give your mnemonic phrase to anyone, not even support staff.
