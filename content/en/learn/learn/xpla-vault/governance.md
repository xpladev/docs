**Avoid unnecessary proposals**

To prevent unnecessary proposals or abuse of the system, all governance proposals must obtain a minimum deposit of 300 XPLA. If 33.4% of the total vote is `NoWithVeto`, `quorum` is not met, or the minimum deposit isn't reached, the deposit will be burned. All other vote outcomes get their deposits refunded. For more information on deposits and refunds, visit the [governance overview]({{< ref "about-xpla-chain#governance" >}}).
